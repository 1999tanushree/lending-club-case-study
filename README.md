## STEPS:
Step 1: Data Cleaning <br><br>
Step 2: Univariate Analysis<br><br>
Step 3: Segemented Univariate Analysis<br><br>
Step 4: Bivaraiate/Multivariate Analysis<br><br>
Step 5: Results<br><br>

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Observation:
1. Higher the interest rate higher charged off ratio.<br><br>
2. Increase in number of charged off with increase in year.<br><br>
3. From this we can conclude that the ones getting 'charged off' have lower annual incomes than the ones.<br><br>
4. Those who already have pub_rec_bankruptcies value 1, have charged off proportion higher than who have no pub_rec_bankruptcies.<br><br>
5. States NE has very high chances of charged off, but number of applications are too low to make any decisions.<br><br>
6. NV,CA and FL states shows good number of charged offs in good number of applications.<br><br>
7. Those who are not working or have less than 1 year of work experience have high chances of getting charged off.<br><br>
8. Interest rate less than 10% has very less chances of charged off. Interest rates are starting from minimum 5 %.<br><br>
9. Interest rate more than 16% has good chances of charged off as compared to other category interest rates.<br><br>
10. Charged off proportion is increasing with higher interest rates.<br><br>
